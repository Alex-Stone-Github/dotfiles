# Dotfiles
## Intro & Install
Hello, these are my configuration files("dotfiles"). I am structuring this project to make it easy to install on a standard unix system with a configuration directory. To install these dotfiles run the following commands:
- Go to the configuration directory: `cd ~/.config`
- Clone these files and this install script: `git clone https://github.com/Alex-Stone-Github/dotfiles.git`
- "CD" into the dir: `cd dotfiles`
- Run the installer: `make install`

_All of the dependencies should be pretty self explanetory: make, git, and neovim + basics..._


# Neovim
In order to get vim up and running. Do the following
Run inside nvim:
    - PackerInstall
    - CocInstall

# Icons
I use proto nerd font. It is bundled into this install script.

# Alacritty
I use alacritty. This installs the configuration for alacritty.
