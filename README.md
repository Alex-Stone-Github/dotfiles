# Dotfiles
## Intro & Install
Hello, these are my configuration files("dotfiles"). I am structuring this project to make it easy to install on a standard unix system with a configuration directory. To install these dotfiles run the following commands:
- Go to the configuration directory: `cd ~/.config`
- Clone these files and this install script: `git clone https://github.com/Alex-Stone-Github/dotfiles.git`
- "CD" into the dir: `cd dotfiles`
- Run the installer: `make install`

_All of the dependencies should be pretty self explanetory: make, git, and neovim + basics..._

# Future
In the future this project will include multiple components, and you will be able to install them seperately.
